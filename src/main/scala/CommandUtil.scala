      |It's an Scala implementation of "The Goose Game Kata" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose)
      |How to use:
      | 1. Define an amount of users and write it in a console.
      | 2. Write users' names in the console
      | 3. Write "move <some-player-name>
      | 4. Repeat until win
      |Rules:
      | During the game program will throw 2 dices every turn. Values of such dices define your future steps.
      | You will win if you reach the 63. But if you collect more than 63, you will be moved back on a difference between 63 and your current amount
      | If you step on a cell where another player is, this player will be sent on your previous position.
      | There are some zone with special abilities:
      |   1. The Bridge(6). When you reach it, you will be moved on 12.
      |   2. The Goose(5, 9, 14, 18, 23, 27). When you reach it, you will move again on the same step.
